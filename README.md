# Yale School of Art Website Redesign

## Project Overview
This project was a collaborative effort in our web development class aimed at redesigning the Yale School of Art website. Our objective was to enhance the site's usability and aesthetics, making it more accessible and appealing to students.

## Design Issues Identified
In our initial analysis, we identified several key areas where the original website was falling short. Our redesign focused on addressing these issues:

- **Disarrayed Layout:** The original site had an unorganized structure, making information hard to find.
- **Overwhelming Colors:** The use of colors was not optimal, leading to a visually overwhelming experience.
- **Distracting Animations:** Unnecessary animations were causing distractions and detracting from the site's content.
- **Inefficient Use of Space:** The site was not fully utilizing the available screen space, leading to a cramped and inefficient layout.
- **Inconsistency:** Design and layout were inconsistent throughout the site, causing confusion and a lack of cohesive visual identity.
- **Conciseness Concerns:** The content was overly verbose in some areas while lacking essential details in others.

## Objectives
Our redesign aimed to address these issues by:
- Creating a well-organized and intuitive layout.
- Implementing a color scheme that is pleasing and conducive to a positive user experience.
- Reducing and refining animations to focus attention on content.
- Optimizing the use of screen space to create a balanced and open layout.
- Ensuring consistency in design elements and layout across the site.
- Balancing the content to be concise yet informative, providing value without overwhelming the user.
