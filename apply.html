			</h3>
			<div class="indent section">
				<p>
					An application to the School of Art requires forethought and planning. It is important to read all of the 
					application instructions carefully. Following these instructions will ensure that your application is viewed 
					to best advantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Yale School of Art application for the 2024–2025 academic year will be available October 2023. The 
					information that follows will assist you in filing the application online. For an explanation of specific 
					requirements for each area of study, please refer to the departmental sections that follow.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div id="undergrad">
				<p>
					The undergraduate admissions process is handled entirely through Yale College. 
					Please refer all undergraduate admissions questions to the <a href="https://admissions.yale.edu/contact-us" target="_blank">

				<h2>ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
				<div class="indent section">
					<p>
						The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. 
						Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university or a 
						diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most 
						particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in 
						the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites 
						if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the 
						committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and 
						competitive basis.
					</p>

				<div id="guidelinesDiv">
					<h2 id="guidelinesHead">ADMISSION GUIDELINES</h2>
					<p>
						Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each year only. Applicants 
						are notified of the admission committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in February, 
						and final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be given over the 
						phone or advance of the batch written release to all finalists.
					</p>
					<p>
						To apply for more than one area of concentration, separate applications and supporting 
						documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the applicant’s 
						experience in that particular field. Applying to more than one program does not increase an 
						applicant’s chances of selection.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Please note: Yale School of Art does not practice admission deferment. An offer of admission is 
						valid only for enrollment for that year</strong> regardless of the in-residence conditions of the Yale 
						campus at that time. Applicants who are offered admission but choose not to enroll are welcome to 
						reapply to the School in a future cycle.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br id="hideBr">
			<h2>APPLICATION DEADLINE</h2>
			<div class="indent section">
				<p>
					Online applications for programs beginning in the 2024–2025 academic year will open October of 2023 
					with a due date of Wednesday, January 10, 2024.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please expect that when many applicants are uploading simultaneously near the deadline, lengthier 
					processing times will be experienced. To avoid this, please consider submitting prior to the deadline day.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<h3>Application Materials:</h3>
			<div id="hideSupLink" class="indent">
				<p>
					The following materials are required for consideration of your application for admission:
				</p>
				<ol class="indent">
					<li>
						<strong>Submit the online application.</strong> Application portal opens early October 2023 and may be worked until 
						the early January 2024. As it generally takes several weeks to complete an application, it is 
						strongly recommended that applicants prepare their materials early to ensure completion by the deadline.<a href="#sup1"><sup>1</sup></a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Nonrefundable application fee of $100.</strong> Please follow payment instructions at <a href="https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/" target="_blank">https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/</a>. 
						Forms of payment include credit card and checking account.<a href="#sup2"><sup>2</sup></a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>A one-page statement</strong> that addresses influences, interests, current work direction, brief life history (as it 
						relates to art/design practice), and reasons for applying to graduate school at this time. Statements should 
						be limited to one page or no more than 500 words.<a href="#sup3"><sup>3</sup></a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>References from three persons</strong>, either practicing/teaching in the field in which application is made, or who 
						knows the applicant’s practice well and can attest to their ability, competency, potential, etc. in Yale’s 
						MFA program.<a href="#sup4"><sup>4</sup></a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Transcripts of academic record</strong> for the bachelor’s degree and/or professional art schools attended. 
						Student/unofficial copies may be uploaded to the application for the preliminary jury. Official transcripts 
						will ONLY be required for applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official transcripts 
						should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior 
						college transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.
					</li>
					<li style="padding-bottom: 0">
						<strong>Portfolio of work.</strong> Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by the stated deadline will NOT be 
						considered. The portfolio should represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction, and 
						demonstrate your ability. At least half of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months, 
						and all should be from within the last three years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and 
						you will not be able to override it. The application system used by Yale requires that one image from the 
						portfolio be designated as a “representative work.” This selection is simply the default image for the cover 
						page of each application file. As such, applicants have historically selected the piece which most strongly 
						represents ideas central to their current body of work.<a href="#sup5"><sup>5</sup></a>

					<div id="note">

							<sup>1</sup>
								The School of Art is NOT part of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and it is not possible to apply by using 
								application materials found on the Graduate School’s Web site.
						</div>
						<br>
						
						<div id="sup2" class="superscript">
							<sup>2</sup>
								Yale School of Art practices “need blind admission,” meaning that candidates' financial need or ability is never disclosed 
								to the admission committee during review of MFA applications. For this reason, and because the processing and careful review of each 
								individual application demands great time and human resources, graduate fee waivers are not available.
							<br><br>
								Beginning in January 2022, the fee may be waived only for applicants with primary citizenship in the following nations only, those with 
								the lowest US exchange rates: Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Sierra Leone, Laos, Guinea, Paraguay, Cambodia.
						</div>
						<br>
						
						<div id="sup3" class="superscript">
							<sup>3</sup>
								Applicants to the Painting/Printmaking program should make reference in their statements to the “representative work” in the portfolio; this 
								is not critical for the other programs.
						</div>
						<br>
						
						<div id="sup4" class="superscript">
							<sup>4</sup>
								The admissions committee reviews applications shortly after the deadline. While it is not uncommon for letters of recommendation to come in 
								past the deadline, please impress upon on those who will be writing on your behalf that late submission of supporting documentation may 
								risk exclusion from the review. Applicants can always view the receipt status of reference requests on the application status page.
						</div>
						<br>
						
						<div id="sup5" class="superscript">
							<sup>5</sup>
								<div>
									Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed other pages of a publication or video within the images you place in your portfolio. 
									Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstances should more than 
									two detail shots be included. <strong>Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of concentration; be sure to follow the instructions for the area 
									to which you are applying</strong>. We strongly recommend that you review your images on a Mac OS to be certain that they are accurately represented.
								</div>
						</div>

						<div class="superscript">
							All supporting documents that are submitted as a requirement for admission become a part of the official file and cannot be returned
