					<span class="font">
						The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students with 
						intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the practice of an 
						array of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts 
						university. As a part of the first institution of higher learning to 
						successfully integrate a studio-based education into such a broad 
						pedagogical framework, the Yale School of Art has a long and 
						distinguished history of training artists of the highest caliber. A 
						full-time faculty of working artists in conjunction with a diverse 
						cross-section of accomplished visiting artists collaborate to design a 
						program and foster an environment where the unique talents and 
						perspectives of individual students can emerge and flourish.
						<br><br>
						The School of Art is founded on the belief that art is a fundamental 
						force in national and international culture, and that one of the primary 
						standards by which societies are judged is the quality, creative 
						freedom, critical insight, and formal and technical innovation of the 
						visual art they produce. The Yale School of Art teaches at the graduate 
						and undergraduate levels, and consequently the student body consists of 
						those whose primary or exclusive focus is art as well as those for whom 
						art is an essential part of a varied course of inquiry. The school 
						currently offers degrees and undergraduate majors in the areas of 
						graphic design, painting / printmaking, photography, and sculpture.

					THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF 
					FINE ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING / PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, 
					AND SCULPTURE
				</h2>
					<p>
						Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are 
						provided an educational context in which they can explore the 
						potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical 
						dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by 
						distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional 
						artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is 
						centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this 
						enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from 
						rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the 
						relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found 
						throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many 
						aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and 
						visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of 
						visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students 
						must bring creative force and imagination to their own development, 
						for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated 
						and appreciated.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in 
						Yale College (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In 
						addition, the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate 
						School of Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the 
						University, and School of Art students may enroll in elective 
						courses in the Graduate School and other professional schools as 
						well as in the College with permission.
