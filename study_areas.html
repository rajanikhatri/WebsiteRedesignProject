				<h2>GRAPHIC DESIGN (MFA)</h2>

						<p>
							The graphic design program focuses on the development of a cohesive, investigative 
							body of work, also known as the student’s thesis. At Yale, the graphic design thesis 
							is conceived as a loose framework within which each student’s visual method is 
							deployed across many diverse projects during the two-year course of study. While 
							every thesis project is unique, there are several common features: a focus on 
							methodology, the application of a visual method to studio work, and the organization 
							of the work in a thoughtfully argued written document and “<em>Thesis Book</em>.”
						</p>
						<p>
							The individual collection of graphic design work by each student is supported on 
							several levels simultaneously: studio work led by faculty meeting weekly; small 
							six-person thesis groups meeting biweekly; individual sessions with writing and 
							editing tutors; and lectures, presentations, and workshops.
						</p>
						<p>
							The School of Art provides digital lab facilities however all graphic design 
							students are expected to have their own personal computer. Each student has a 
							designated work space in the design studio loft and has access to equipment including 
							bookbinding materials, wide format printers, a RISO duplicator, Vandercook press, and 
							work spaces in the School of Art buildings. More resources supporting interdisciplinary 
							projects including motion capture and VR is available at the nearby Center for 
							Collaborative Arts and Media. In addition, students draw on the extraordinary resources 
							of Yale University courses, conferences, films, lectures, and museums, and especially 
							the extensive research and rare book collections of Sterling, Haas, and Beinecke libraries.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each year, up to twelve students are admitted into the two-year graphic design program, and 
							up to six students are admitted into the preliminary-year program. Two-year program students 
							typically have a BFA in Graphic Design and are expected to have substantial and distinguished 
							professional experience. Students applying to the preliminary-year program typically have 
							relevant experience in a field of study outside design and demonstrate evidence of strong 
							visual acuity. After successful completion of the preliminary year, these students 
							automatically continue on in the two-year M.F.A. program.

				<h2>PAINTING AND PRINTMAKING (MFA)</h2>
				<div class="margin studyArea section indent">

						<img src="images/painting.webp" alt="bird painting" class="studyAreaImg">
					</div>
					
					<div class="studyAreaText section">
						<p>
							Instruction in the program is rooted in the investigation of painting as a unique 
							genre with its own complex syntax and history. Within this setting, the program 
							encourages diversity of practice and interpretation, innovation, and experimentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Approximately twenty-one students are admitted each year. At the core of instruction 
							are individual and group critiques with faculty, visiting critics, and visiting artists. 
							In addition, students participate in a variety of seminars taught by both faculty and 
							critics. The study of printmaking is integrated into the painting program, and a student 
							may concentrate in painting, printmaking, or a combination of the two.
						</p>
						<p>
							Students work in individual 300-square-foot studios at 353 Crown Street adjacent to Green 
							Hall. Students have access to a printmaking workshop in the Crown Street building, 
							equipped with two etching presses and a lithography press, a fully equipped silkscreen 
							facility, as well as digital resources available in the print studio, throughout the School, 
							and at the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media.

				<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY (MFA)</h2>
				<div class="margin studyArea indent section">
					<div class="studyAreaImgDiv">
						<img src="images/photography.jpg" alt="photography equipment" class="studyAreaImg">
					</div>
					
					<div class="studyAreaText section">
						<p>
							Photography is a two-year program of study admitting ten students a year. Darkroom, studio, 
							and computer facilities are provided. Students receive technical instruction in 
							black-and-white and color photography as well as nonsilver processes and digital image 
							production.
						</p>
						<p>
							The program is committed to a broad definition of photography as a lens-based medium open 
							to a variety of expressive means. Students work both individually and in groups with faculty 
							and visiting artists. In addition, a critique panel composed of faculty and other artists or 
							critics meets weekly, as well as for a final review each term, to discuss student work.
						</p>

				<h2>SCULPTURE (MFA)</h2>
				<div class="margin studyArea indent section">
					<div class="studyAreaImgDiv">
						<img src="images/sculpting.png" alt="potter making pottery" class="studyAreaImg">
					</div>
					
					<div class="studyAreaText section">
						<p>
							The sculpture program offers students the opportunity to develop their work in a supportive 
							environment consisting of critical feedback in a broad array of diverse voices. The field 
							of sculpture includes a varied collection of working methods and outcomes—one set of tools 
							is not privileged over another—creating a healthy and experimental program that mirrors the 
							issues facing artists outside of the institution. Students work independently in individual 
							studio spaces and have access to common areas for the critique of their work. 36 Edgewood 
							houses the sculpture program and has a woodworking shop, a metal shop, and a computer lab, 
							while additional resources are offered by the School of Art and the University at large. No 
							metal-casting or ceramic facilities are available.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main focus of this program is to facilitate the development of conversation and 
							constructive critique among students and faculty. Our aim is to articulate student 
							work vis-à-vis its own trajectory and in relation to art history and the current moment. 
							This conversation is formally structured to take place one-on-one between students and 
							faculty, in small groups, and within a larger group involving the whole sculpture 
							department.
						</p>
						<p>
							Approximately ten students are admitted each year.

								Critical Practice is not a formal area of study in the School of Art; however, the critical and 
								theoretical elements undergirding the studio-based practice of students extends through multiple 
								courses and initiatives offered throughout the School. These initiatives include ongoing cooperations 
								with other professional schools and departments at the University that take the form of 
								interdisciplinary workshops, international fellowships and residencies, seminar series, applied 
								research projects, and extensive public programming—all of which seeks to engage multiple disciplines 
								and a broader public in expanding the pedagogical framework surrounding the study of art.

							<p>
								Studies in interdisciplinary media, as well as in film and video, are not formal areas of study in 
								the School of Art; however, a number of students work primarily in film/video or interdisciplinary 
								media while enrolled in other areas.
							</p>
							<p>
								The School offers graduate video courses taught by practicing video artists. These classes address 
								fundamental technical issues as well as the far more challenging questions of the contemporary practice 
								of video by artists and this medium’s relation to other forms of art practice. Classes in video are 
								taught in a variety of locations throughout the School of Art and are attended by students from all 
								areas of study.
